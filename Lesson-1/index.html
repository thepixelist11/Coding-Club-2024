    // Console is like a folder with many functions and properties in it.
    // Log is one of these functions
    // Inside the parentheses there is a 'string' which is text. This is a parameter.
    console.log('Hello World!')

    // This is a variable defined by let. Its value is initialized as text, which is a string.
    let myVariable = 'text'

    // This is a constant initialized with const as 15, a number. This cannot be changed
    const myConstant = 15

    // This will output whether or not myVariable is equal to myConstant (true or false).
    console.log(myVariable == myConstant) // false

    // This will change the value of myVariable to 20. This cannot be done to myConstant because it is constant and cannot be changed.
    myVariable = 20

    // This will log true or false based on whether or not myVariable is greater than myConstant.
    console.log(myVariable > myConstant) // true

    // Other comparison operators are:
    // <   - less than
    // >   - greater than
    // ==  - equal to
    // !=  - not equal to
    // <=  - less than or equal to
    // >=  - greater than or equal to

    // Will increase myVariable by 3
    myVariable = myVariable + 3
    console.log(myVariable) // 23

    // Other arithmatic operators are:
    //  -  - minus
    //  /  - division
    //  *  - multiplication
    //  +  - addition

    // To increment or decrement a value by one, you can use ++ or --
    myVariable++  // Plus 1
    myVariable--  // Minus 1

    // To change a variable by a specific amount, you can use -=, +=, *=, and /=
    myVariable -= 5  // Minus 5
    myVariable += 5  // Plus 5
    myVariable *= 5  // Times 5
    myVariable /= 5  // Divided by 5

    // An if statement will run the code in the 'if' part of it if the input is true.
    // Otherwise, the 'else' part will run. Having an else is optional.
    // In this example, it will be true if myVariable divided by 2 is less than or equal to myConstant
    if((myVariable / 2) <= myConstant) {
      console.log('It was true')

      console.log('Greater than 10!')
    }

    // Loops can be used to repeatedly run code
    // A common loop is the 'for' loop. This has an incrementor value, usually i, a condition that it will check and will only continue the loop if its true, and an incrementor, usually i++
    // In this example, the loop will run 5 times with i starting at 0 and ending at 4. The index i will be logged each time the loop runs
    // The loop will run fully in one frame, so if you were to have a loop that runs an infinite number of times (called an infinite loop), your program will crash.
    for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      console.log('The index is ' + i)
    }

    // Another common loop is the while loop. This does not have an incrementor, and will run as long as the condition is true.
    // In this example, myVariable will be decremented by 3 and logged until myVariable is less than or equal to 5
    while(myVariable > 5) {
      myVariable -= 3
      console.log(myVariable)
    }

    // You can nest code inside of the braces ( {} ) of other statements and loops (often referred to as code blocks)
    for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      if(i == 2) {
        for(let j = 5; j > 0; j--) {
          console.log(j)
        }
      } else {
        console.log(i)
      }

    // In JavaScript, there are many different built-in data types. These are broken into two catagories: primitive and non-primitive.
    // There are seven primitive data types:
    Number     // Simply just a number
    String     // Text
    Boolean    // Can be either true or false
    Null       // The intentional absence of any value
    undefined  // An uninitialized variable (usually)
    Symbol     // Often used as unique identifiers for object properties
    BigInt     // A primitive that supports larger numbers at the cost of speed

    // When it comes to non-primitive data types, there are many that are built into JavaScript, here are some common examples:
    Object     // A collection of key-value pairs represented by { a: 1, b: 2, ... }
    Array      // A collection of values indexed by non-negative integers starting at 0. Represented by [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    Function   // A type of object used to define reusable blocks of code
